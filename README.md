# Code Sensei – Your AI Coding Mentor

Code Sensei is a **Visual Studio Code extension** that aims to bridge the gap between AI-assisted coding and genuine understanding. With the rise of AI-generated code snippets, developers often copy-paste solutions without fully grasping how they work.

**Code Sensei** makes that learning process engaging by:

-  **Detecting pasted vs. handwritten code**
-  **Reacting with a dynamic, expressive mascot**
-  **Explaining the pasted code using an AI model**
-  **Quizzing the user to reinforce understanding**

## Mission

We believe that AI should **support** learning — not replace it. Code Sensei helps ensure developers truly understand what they’re writing by:

- Detecting copy/pasted code patterns vs. handwritten input
- Providing clear explanations for pasted code
- Generating personalized quizzes to test your comprehension
- Adapting to your learning style and providing study plans

All while being accompanied by a helpful and expressive mascot!

The Code Sensei mascot changes its expression based on your coding behavior:

| Emotion | Trigger | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
|  Idle | Not typing for a while | ![Idle](./media/screenshots/focus.png) |
